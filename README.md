# RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LangChain

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain. The notebook demonstrates how to implement and utilize RAG for enhancing text generation tasks by incorporating retrieval mechanisms.

## Repository Contents

- `RAG_using_Langchain.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of RAG using LangChain, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-using-Langchain.git
    cd RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-using-Langchain
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `RAG_using_Langchain.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LangChain.

## Notes

- The notebook contains various examples and use cases for RAG. Modify the examples as needed to fit your specific requirements.
